# The Retro Red Planet of Risk

A very basic game based on the theme of "The Red Planet" for [Pyweek 34](https://pyweek.org/34)

## Introduction

As an alien, your task is to stop humans settling on the Red Planet.

Shoot the Mars rovers, and avoid the satellite beams and asteroids. You may encounter a few dust storms along the way.

## Controls

Use the left and right arrow keys (or the "a" and "d" keys) to move left and right.

Use the spacebar to fire.

## Running the game

You will need to be running Python 3.7 above and to have Pygame installed. I've only tested with the version
of Pygame in requirements.txt.

Run `python run_game.py` to play.
